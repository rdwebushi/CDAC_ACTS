docker0 - docker interface for communication

Note: Container have its own network and the service running inside container can't be accessed
directly on the host machine we need to do proper host to container mapping
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each container gets a different IP from docker engine

Container 1 will get the ip as : 172.17.0.2
Container 2 will get the IP as : 172.17.0.3

How to host http-server in container

Offical Image repository

https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd


sudo docker build -t apachecos:diot .

docker run -dit --name apache1 -p 6010:80 apachecos:diot

-d --> detached (running container in backgroud)

-p <host port number>:<containerport number> 

Container port number is the expose port number in Docker file

-p (is used for mapping host machine port number to the container port number)

So that services runnin gon container port can be exposed on the host machine

What does DFOREGROUND do in CentOS:?
The -DFOREGROUND option does indeed mean that Apache won't fork, 
but that doesn't mean that it's attached to your shell!
The service is started by systemd when you run systemctl start httpd 
(or the old style way, service httpd start). 
It is systemd to which Apache is attached, 
and systemd is managing the process as one of its children. 
This is done so that systemd can easily tell whether Apache has crashed, 
without having to poll a pid file.
This also means that systemd is capable of automatically restarting Apache
if it does crash.
