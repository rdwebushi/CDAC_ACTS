Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. It provides the following major features:

    Repositories: Push and pull container images.
    Teams & Organizations: Manage access to private repositories of container images.
    Official Images: Pull and use high-quality container images provided by Docker.
    Publisher Images: Pull and use high- quality container images provided by external vendors.
    Builds: Automatically build container images from GitHub and Bitbucket and push them to Docker Hub.
    Webhooks: Trigger actions after a successful push to a repository to integrate Docker Hub with other services.

sudo docker image | head -2

sudo docker tag mygccapp:diot bhupendrajmd/testiot:helloworldinc

#Ensure use lowercase letter names while writing image tag name

#once image is tagged : Push it to docker hub

sudo docker push 

sudo docker push bhupendrajmd/testiot:helloworldinc
